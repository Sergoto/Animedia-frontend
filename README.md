## Project Description
               Animedia is a Anime Database for the Anime lover! 
               Animedia is designed to let users create accounts and then be able to 
               explore, discover and add Animes to your library. 
               With such an expansive Anime library out there it's easy to get lost in it all. 
               But hopefully with the user friendly UI/UX design users can navigate their way through 
               different Animes and discover new favorites or take a deeper dive into their old classics.
## Technology Used
- Languages: JavaScript, HTML5, CSS
- Notable Frameworks/Dependencies: [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)

  
## User Stories
  
- As a user I want to be able to create an account and login and logout.
- As a user I want to be able to scroll through the different Animes.
- As a user I want to be able to find out more about the different Animes I discover as well as add them to my list.
